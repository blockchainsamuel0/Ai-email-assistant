# **App Name**: Contextual Chat

## Core Features:

- Chat UI: Provide a user interface for real-time chat interaction, for web and mobile.
- Knowledge Base Loading: Load the `corpus.txt` file as the application's knowledge base.
- Serverless Backend: Implement the backend logic as a serverless function to handle requests via Vercel.
- Real-time Responses: Provide real-time responses by processing user input against the knowledge base.
- Placeholder Replacement: Replace placeholders (e.g., `{name}`, `{topic}`) within the knowledge base responses using provided input.
- Conversation Memory: Store and maintain conversation history in memory within the serverless environment.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark blue (#2E3192) to evoke trust and reliability.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F2F5), a desaturated shade of the primary color, to ensure comfortable readability and a clean interface.
- Accent color: Soft violet (#807ECD), an analogous hue to the primary color, used for highlighting interactive elements and calls to action.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, neutral, and readable experience.
- Use simple, clear icons to represent different functions and commands within the chat interface.
- Design a clean, intuitive layout with a clear separation between the chat input area, message display, and any additional controls.
- Use subtle animations for loading states and message transitions to enhance the user experience without being distracting.
